## Overview

Dozer is a **real time data movement tool leveraging CDC from various sources to multiple sinks.**

Dozer is magnitudes of times faster than Debezium+Kafka and natively supports stateless transformations. 
Primarily used for moving data into warehouses. In our own application, we move data to **Clickhouse** and build data APIs and integration with LLMs. 

## How to use it
Dozer runs with a single configuration file like the following:
```yaml
app_name: dozer-bench
version: 1
connections:
  - name: pg_1
    config: !Postgres
      user: user
      password: postgres
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      database: customers
sinks:
  - name: customers
    config: !Dummy
      table_name: customers
```

For a complete application example, see the [personalized banking chatbot](samples/banking-chatbot/README.md), which combines Dozer customer profiles with LangChain, Chroma, and a local LLM.
